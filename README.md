# Linear_Circuit_solver

Solves linear circuits based on an improvised nodal analysis technique: visit https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Systems/Electrical/mna/MNA2.html for more details.
Currently supports resistances, current and voltage sources as input and solves for node voltages, branch currents. Support for inductors/capacitors/alternating circuits will be added soon.

Guidelines: Click on a line in the grid to select and click again to deselect. Choose your ground node by clicking on a node (the intersection of any two lines)
